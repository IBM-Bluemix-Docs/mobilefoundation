# Manage app versions
{: #manage_app_versions}

The Mobile Foundation application management capabilities provide Mobile Foundation Server users and administrators with granular control over user and device access to their applications.

Mobile Foundation server tracks all attempts to access your mobile infrastructure and stores information about the application, the user, and the device on which the application is installed. The mapping between the application, the user, and the device forms the basis for the serverâ€™s mobile-application management capabilities.

Using the Mobile Foundation Operations console you can monitor and manage access to your resources, you can also manage your specific application version.

1.  Go to Mobile Foundation Operations console, click **Applications**, choose the application you want to manage, select the specific version of the application you are interested in, from the **Versions** list displayed.
