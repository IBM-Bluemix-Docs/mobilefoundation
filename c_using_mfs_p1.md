#	Set up using the Developer plan
{: #using_mobilefoundation_p1}

After you create the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} service instance using the Developer plan, access the Overview page on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. Here you're provided with tutorials and videos to help you get started with the service.

## Working with the MobileFirst server
{: #start_mobilefoundation_p1}
* You can instantly access and work with the MobileFirst Server.

  This selection creates an {{site.data.keyword.mfserver_long_notm}} with the following settings:
  *	1 GB of memory. This size is enough for development, light testing activities and small scale production workloads.

  * To access the MobileFirst Server using CLI you'll need the credentials, which are available when you click **Service credentials** from the left navigation pane of the IBM Cloud console.

You can now manage your mobile apps and mobile devices, use your server as a mobile backend, send push notifications, and do more.
