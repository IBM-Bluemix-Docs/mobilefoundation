#	Using the Developer plan
{: #using_mobilefoundation_p1}

After you create the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefoundation_short}} service instance using the Developer plan, access the Overview page on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. Here you're provided with tutorials and videos to help you get started with the service.

## Working with the MobileFirst server
{: #start_mobilefoundation_p1}
* You can instantly access and work with the MobileFirst Server.

  This selection creates an {{site.data.keyword.mfserver_long_notm}} with the following settings:
  *	1 GB of memory. This size is enough for development, light testing activities and small scale production workloads.

  * To access the MobileFirst Server using CLI you'll need the credentials, which are available when you click **Service credentials** from the left navigation pane of the IBM Cloud console.

<!--  The process of provisioning starts. This process takes about 10 minutes, and a message window indicates the progress of this operation. When complete a dashboard is displayed where you can see:
    *	The status of your server that is running (state, size).

    *	The server route created for you. Use this route in your mobile application to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.mfserver_short_notm}}.

    *	Your personal `username` and `password` to access the {{site.data.keyword.mfp_oc_short_notm}}. The `password` is hidden. Click **Show Password** icon to visualize it.

*	Click **Launch Console** to launch the {{site.data.keyword.mfp_oc_short_notm}}.-->

You can now manage your mobile apps and mobile devices, use your server as a mobile backend, send push notifications, and do more.

## Mobile Analytics
{: #mobile_analytics}

Mobile Analytics server is included and preconfigured with the Mobile Foundation: Developer plan service instance.

* Launch the Mobile Analytics Console from the {{site.data.keyword.mfp_oc_short_notm}}.
