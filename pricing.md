## Developer
{: #developer_plan}

The Developer plan is a free plan. This plan creates a Mobile Foundation server as a Cloud Foundry application on a *Liberty for Java* runtime. *Liberty for Java* is billed separately and isn't included in this plan. Mobile Analytics is offered at no additional charge with events that are retained for 6 months. This plan doesn’t support the use of external databases and is restricted to development and testing. With the Mobile Foundation server Developer plan instance, you can register any number of Mobile applications for development and testing, but the plan restricts the number of connected devices to 10 per day.

## Professional 1 Application
